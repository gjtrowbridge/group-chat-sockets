This is a very simple group chat application.

There is no data persistence, so any server restarts will cause all chats to be lost.

I built this application because I wanted to try out socket.io (spoiler alert: it is awesome).

To run this application:

* Make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed locally
* Clone this repository to your local machine
* Navigate to the directory where you cloned this repository
* Run `npm install`
* Run `node server.js`
* Go to http://localhost:8080 in more than 1 browser window
* Chat back and forth between the 2+ browser windows
